PHASE 1 LOADING DATA:
-------------------
Before the user sees ANYTHING on screen, the program needs to "wake up."

What happens here:
1. Check if data files exist (employees.txt, assets.txt)
2. If files exist → Read them and convert text back into Python Objects
3. If files don't exist → Start with empty dictionaries
4. Prepare the system for user interaction

Think of this like a computer booting up - it needs to load everything
into memory (RAM) before you can use it.
